    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a student who loves to play video games and watch anime</p>

    <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
    <p>I am trying to finish up school right now. I am working on using a raspberry pi to
         count the number of people who enter a building. Then I will take that data and post it on a dashboard.</p>
